********************************************************************************************

GenepticonPy is a Python neural network library for Python 2.7, its algorithm architeture
is based on feedforward multilayer perceptron model and its library network training is 
based on genetic algorithm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron

The library includes some required classes to work with its artificial neural network 
architeture, such as: Network, Dendrite, AxonTerminal, Neuron and Gen (class that implements 
the training based on genetic algorithm).
