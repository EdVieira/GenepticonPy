GenepticonPy - Artificial Neural Network with its training based in Genetic Algorithm

Copyright Â© 2016 Eduardo Henrique Vieira dos Santos

GenepticonPy was developed using Python 2.7.

The first idea to make it was a trying to clarify and unify understandings about 
functional concepts like Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm.

I'm releasing this architeture kind hoping to help you understand part of 
its concepts and operations.

Network tends to content a set of layers that it will work with. In a MLP they are: an input layer; one or more hidden layer; an output layer.

Dendrite tends to be a set of Neurons, corresponding to the concept of layers.
A Dendrite may have one or more Neurons within.
The activation of each Dendrite set is done by the Network.

The communication between Neurons in different layers is intermediated by its 
AxonTerminals.
