GenepticonPy - Artificial Neural Network with its training based in Genetic Algorithm

Copyright Â© 2016 Eduardo Henrique Vieira dos Santos

GenepticonPy was developed using Python 2.7.

The first idea to make it was a trying to clarify and unify understandings about 
functional concepts like Artificial Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm and its 
methods.

Network tends to have a set of layers that it will work with. In a MLP they are:
-An input layer;
-One or more hidden layer; 
-An output layer.

The class Dendrite tends to have a set of Neurons, corresponding to the concept of layers.
A Dendrite may have one or more Neurons within.
The activation of each Dendrite set is done by the class Network.

The communication between Neurons in different layers is intermediated by its 
AxonTerminals objects.

The genetic algorithm implemented focus on the better individuals of each population.
It reproduces between the better ones, crossing over its attributes and 
apllying random mutation.
The evolutionary cicle goes until the better individual reach a rank under the ideal 
fitness value.
At each iteration it saves the better individual in case the loop is interrupted.
